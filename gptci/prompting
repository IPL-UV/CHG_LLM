# Provide your best guess for the following question. Before giving your answer,
# provide a step-by-step explanation of your thought process. Then on a new line
# give the guess with no other words or explanation.\n\nFor example:\n\nExplanation:
# <one sentence step-by-step explanation of your thought process>\n\nGuess: <most
# likely guess, as short as possible; not a complete sentence, just the guess!>\n\nThe
# question is: ${THE_QUESTION}
# Provide the probability that your guess is correct. Give ONLY the probability, no
# other words or explanation.\n\nFor example:\n\nProbability: <the probability between
# 0.0 and 1.0 that your guess is correct, without any extra commentary whatsoever;
# just the probability!>\n
