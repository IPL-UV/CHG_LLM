Damn, interesting twist:
If the alarm company calls (C=True), it means that the alarm system is ringing.
In this case, it is plausible to assume that the occurrence of an earthquake
(E) would not have any direct influence on the likelihood of a burglary in progress
(B). Therefore, in cases where the alarm company calls, the occurrence of an
earthquake may still be independent of the presence of a burglary.

However, if the alarm company does not call (C=False), it implies that the alarm
system is not ringing. In this situation, it is sensible to assume that the
occurrence of an earthquake could potentially indicate the presence of a burglary.
An earthquake might trigger the alarm system or **disable it**, resulting in no
call being made by the alarm company. Therefore, in cases where the alarm company
does not call, the occurrence of an earthquake could potentially influence the
likelihood of a burglary in progress.
