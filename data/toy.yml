context: "Objects that are linked together in a probabilistic Rube Goldberg machine. If the ball is set in motion, it always hits the domino and makes it fall. 
          If the little car is set in motion it only sometimes hits the domino and makes it fall. 
          If the little car is set in motion it always hits the mikado stick. 
          If the mikado stick is hit, it always falls and sometimes hits a bell which than rings. 
          If the domino falls it always hits the bell and makes it ring. 
          If the domino falls it also always hits a switch and activates it. 
          If the switch is activated the light is turned on.
          The little car and the Ball can be set in to motion completely independently.
          There are no other possible ways in which the objects can directly interact than the mentioned ones."
